[Add your feedback on backend architecture here]
i think moving to contaized approach maybe better perhaps intergarating mongdb and some monitoring elk stack using kafka and grafana to help track the effectiveness of the core backend and maybe a database like elastic perhaps check online with my suggestions and feedback options and path want to go down the opensource root if possible we need to look at the content analyser first provider me a review of what its doing and i can then try brainstorm some feedback on this?
